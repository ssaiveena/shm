This repository contains data and code related to the Sociohydrological model study for publication in WRR

The methodological framework for developing alternative CLDs and SHMs is as follows
1. Preliminary conceptualization from natural processes and assuming rationale decision maker (CLD1 and SHM1)
2. Identify stakeholders and conduct semi-structured interviews
3. Develop alternative CLDs from stakeholder elicitation
4. Develop SHMs using the information in CLDs
5. Validate using historical data
6. Assess water and food security during historical data

In the following, the repository data is arranged as per the methodological framework
1. The CLD1 developed from preliminary conceptualization is added in the folder [CLD1](https://github.com/ssaiveena/shm/tree/main/CLD1)
2. Details on semi-structured interviews are added in the manuscript
3. Alternative CLDs (CLD2 and CLD3) are added in the folder [CLD2 and CLD3](https://github.com/ssaiveena/shm/tree/main/CLD2%20and%20CLD3)
4. Simulating the developed SHMs are using the Matlab code main.m https://github.com/ssaiveena/shm/blob/main/main.m
5. Each SHM is simulated using this code
6. The validation of historical data is included in the folder [Historical_Validation] (https://github.com/ssaiveena/shm/tree/main/Historical_validation)
7. The water and food security indicators are assessed using the code in folder assess_water_food_security
